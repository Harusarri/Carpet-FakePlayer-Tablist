# Carpet-FakePlayerTagger
A simple Scarpet script for Minecraft Carpet mod that automatically tags fake players (bots) for easy identification.

## Features

- Adds a `[BOT]` prefix to bot names.
- Changes bot names to a gray color.
- Helps to easily distinguish bots from real players in the tab list.

## Installation

1.  Place `bot.sc` into your world's `/scripts` folder.
2.  Run `/script load bot` in-game.
3.  Spawn a bot with `/player <name> spawn` to see the effect.

## Customization

You can edit the prefix and color by modifying the variables at the top of the `bot.sc` file.
